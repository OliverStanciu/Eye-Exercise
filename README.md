# Eye Exercise

This is a fun exercise where you can clone a repository and see how the eyes on a webpage follow your mouse's movement. By manipulating styles, you can give the eyes more character and make your webpage more dynamic.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository onto your local machine using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

>git clone https://github.com/OliverStanciu/Eye-Exercise.git

Once you have cloned the repository, open the `eyes.html` file in your preferred code editor and launch it on your default browser.

## Usage

After opening the `eyes.html` file, you will see two eyes on the screen. Move your mouse around the screen and watch as the eyes follow your movement.

To adjust the eyes' style, open the `eyes.css` file and make any changes you desire. You can change the size, color, shape, and position of the eyes to give them more character and make your webpage more dynamic.

Feel free to experiment with different styles and see how they affect the eyes' appearance and movement.

## Contributing

This exercise is a fun and engaging way to learn how to manipulate styles using CSS. If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to fork the repository and make your changes.
